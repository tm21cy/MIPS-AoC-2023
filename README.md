# MIPS-AoC-2023
My Advent of Code submissions, done purely in MIPS assembly via MARS. This was a personal interest project of mine - I tutor enough MIPS for it to be stuck in my head all the time - and figured "why not make a seemingly easy challenge extremely complicated?"

Feel free to reproduce any of this code logic (please, ignore my obscene comments likely made at 1am). As I mentioned, I did this for no pay, no grade, just interest over exams.
